# Weather App

## Description
This app takes data from the Open Weather API and allows you to search the name of any city around the world. You will receive what the current weather is like outside, as well as for the next five days after that point as well.

There are lots of improvements I'd like to make over time. I'd like to fix the text formatting of the dates and times, which is possible with Moment.js. I'd like to make the styling of the page a lot more appealing. I would possibly like to include more data, or data for several weeks out if possible. 

I feel that this project, along with Project 1, really helped me feel more confident about my coding abilities. Woo!

## User Story
AS A traveler  
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities  
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
[x] GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs  
[x] WHEN I search for a city  
[x] THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history  
[x] WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city  
[x] THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed  
[x] WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city  
[x] THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity  
[x] WHEN I click on a city in the search history  
[x] THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city  
 
## Sources
To get both current and future weather data, I used [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
